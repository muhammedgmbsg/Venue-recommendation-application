# Venue_Recommendation_Mobile_Application
## It is a mobile application where I use mongodb as a database and flutter as an interface.
**Project Purpose:** It allows the user to find the best 20 venues in the location they are looking for, using the Google Maps API to give accurate advice on venue selection.
**Project Scope:** The user first registers and logs in to the system by entering his e-mail address and password. When registering, the user goes through an e-mail verification phase. The user searches for a city, district and sector as a location. The 20 best places in the location he searched appear. Detailed information such as the address, phone number, star working hours and website of each venue, which is found on Google, is presented to the user on the application. If the user wishes, he can access these places later by adding them to his favorites.
